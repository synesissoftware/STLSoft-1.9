# STLSoft - TODO

**NOTE**: some of the following are very old, stretching back even into the 2000s, so this list will be updated a lot over the coming months. The most glaring of these is to ensure compatiblity with C++-14/17/20 as is necessary.

## STLSoft 1.9.x TODOs:

* documentation improvements - Deferred. Will be done for STLSoft 1.11+
* website improvements - Deferred. Will be done for STLSoft 1.11+
* `scoped_method` - this is available in STLSoft 1.10
* `scoped_method` - this is available in STLSoft 1.10
* custom radix in `integer_to_string` - this is abandoned, but significant improvements are available in **1.10**
* **C++ 11/14/17** compatibility - Deferred. Will be available in **1.10+**


## STLSoft 1.10+ TODOs:
