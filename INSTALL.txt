 NOTE: STLSoft 1.9 is obsolete; please instead use STLSoft 1.10, which may
  be obtained from https://github.com/synesissoftware/STLSoft-1.10

============================================================================

 STLSoft is a 100% header-only library, and so requires no building.

 It is recommended that you define an STLSOFT environment variable.
 
 For example, if you're using UNIX and you install
  to /usr/local/stlsoft/stlsoft-1.9.133 then you should set the environment
  variable STLSOFT to /usr/local/stlsoft/stlsoft-1.9.133 in which case the
  file stlsoft/stlsoft.h will be located in
  $STLSOFT/include/stlsoft/stlsoft.h
  
 Conversely, if you're using Windows and you intall
  to C:\3pty\STLSoft\stlsoft-1.9.133 then you should set the environment
  variable STLSoft to C:\3pty\STLSoft\stlsoft-1.9.133 in which case the
  file stlsoft/stlsoft.h will be located in
  C:\3pty\STLSoft\stlsoft-1.9.133\stlsoft\stlsoft.h

 If you're using STLSoft on UNIX, you might want to apply dos2unix over all
 the files before using it. You *must* do this if you're using the SunPro
 C compiler.
