============================================================================



There are several ways in which you can help the STLSoft project:

 1. Defect reports
 2. Feature requests
 3. Volunteer your help
 4. Sponsor development
 5. Write articles, blog-posts about your experiences
 6. Help flesh out the Wikipedia page for STLSoft


1. Defect reports
-----------------

We're very keen to hear of any problems you have in using the libraries.

Please submit an issue at:

  https://github.com/synesissoftware/STLSoft-1.9/issues

Please help us to help you by submitting as much information about the
problem as you think is relevant, including:

 * the compiler you're using
 * the architecture and operating system you're targeting
 * the version of STLSoft
 * the version of other 3rd-party libraries, such as Boost, Loki, ...
 * whether you're building using the makefiles or via an IDE
 * a section of the build output, including the warnings/errors involved


2. Feature requests
-------------------

If there are features that you think would enhance the libraries, please
feel free to share your ideas.

You can either submit an issue:

  https://github.com/synesissoftware/STLSoft-1.9/issues

Or provide your suggested work via a pull-request:

  https://github.com/synesissoftware/STLSoft-1.9/pulls


3. Volunteer your help
----------------------

If you have any components you'd like to submit to the libraries, or you
would like to offer any other help, please get in contact.

In particular, at the moment we're hoping to move to redevelop the STLSoft
website using MediaWiki and we'd be keen to hear from anyone who has skills
in this area (as we don't!)


4. Sponsor development
----------------------

If you value the diligence and effort that's gone into bringing you this
software, please make a donation to the project, via:

  https://sourceforge.net/project/project_donations.php?group_id=238860


5. Write articles, blog-posts about your experiences
----------------------------------------------------

If you've written articles or blogged about STLSoft, let us know and we'll
list them on the website, at:

  http://www.stlsoft.org/

If you haven't yet, please consider doing so.


6. Help flesh out the Wikipedia page for STLSoft
------------------------------------------------

Martin Moene has made a great start with the STLSoft Wikipedia page, but
there's lots more to be done. You can help out by updating the STLSoft
Wikipedia page at:

  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STLSoft
