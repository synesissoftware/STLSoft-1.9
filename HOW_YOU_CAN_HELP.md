## Defect reports

We're very keen to hear of any problems you have in using the libraries.

Please submit an issue at:

  https://github.com/synesissoftware/STLSoft-1.9/issues

Please help us to help you by submitting as much information about the
problem as you think is relevant, including:

* the compiler you're using
* the architecture and operating system you're targeting
* the version of STLSoft
* the version of other 3rd-party libraries, such as Boost, Loki, ...
* whether you're building using CMake, the provided makefiles, or via an IDE
* a section of the build output, including the warnings/errors involved


## Feature requests

If there are features that you think would enhance the libraries, please
feel free to share your ideas, but do so via the [**STLSoft-1.10**](https://github.com/synesissoftware/STLSoft-1.10/)
project.

You can either submit an issue:

  https://github.com/synesissoftware/STLSoft-1.10/issues

Or provide your suggested work via a pull-request:

  https://github.com/synesissoftware/STLSoft-1.10/pulls


## Volunteer your help

If you have any components you'd like to submit to the libraries, or you
would like to offer any other help, please get in contact.

In particular, at the moment we're hoping to move to redevelop the STLSoft
website using MediaWiki and we'd be keen to hear from anyone who has skills
in this area (as we don't!)
